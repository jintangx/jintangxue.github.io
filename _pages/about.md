I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Southern California, supervised by [Prof. C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh){:target="_blank"} in [Media Communication Lab](https://mcl.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to joining USC as a Ph.D. student, I received my B.S. in Communication Engineering from Shanghai University in 2021 and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from USC in 2023. My research interests include natural language processing (NLP) and knowledge graphs (KGs).
